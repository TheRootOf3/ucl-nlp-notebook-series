    "## 7. Naive-Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the previous notebook, Naive-Bayes is a supervised learning probabilistic classifier. It is based on applying Bayes' probability theorem and using the fact that occurrence of an event impacts the probability of another event. But how exactly does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1. NB Fundamentals\n",
    "The general purpose of classifiers is to *classify* samples from the dataset into 2 or more **classes**. Since we want to classify text, instead of term *sample* we will use term **document**. Thus, classifiers' task is to take an input document *d* and out of all possible classes, return a class *c*, to which the document *d* belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since NB is the probabilistic classifier, its role would be to **maximize the probability** of the predicted class c given the input document d.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"res/eq1.png\" alt=\"!!!equation 4.1!!!\" width=\"300\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition of Bayesian classification is to use **Bayes’ rule** to transform the equation above into their probabilities that have some useful properties.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"res/eq2.png\" alt=\"!!!equation 4.2!!!\" width=\"300\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We then substitute the first equation into the second one to get:\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"res/eq3.png\" alt=\"!!!equation 4.3!!!\" width=\"400\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can conveniently simplify the above equation by dropping the denominator *P(d)*. This is possible because we will be computing *P(d|c)P(c) / P(d)* for each possible class, but *P(d)* does not change for each class; we are always asking the most likely class for the same article *d*, which must have the same probability *P(d)*. Thus, we can choose the class that maximises the simpler formula\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"res/eq4.png\" alt=\"!!!equation 4.4!!!\" width=\"400\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, but how do we actually represent a document *d*? We can represent a document as a set of **features** `d = (f1, f2, f3 ... fn)`. One way to define these features is to use the Bag-of-words model introduced in the Notebook 2. After contstructing the BOW of the complete dataset, we will be able to express each document as a vector of word counts. Thus, we can treat each vector value associated with a different word as a separate feature giving us information on the words (and optionally their counts) used in the document. Here we also introduce the first of two **simplifying assumptions**: since we use BOW, the **word ordering doesn't matter**. We don't care about the position of a word in a document.\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"res/eq5.png\" alt=\"!!!equation 4.6!!!\" width=\"400\"/></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, calculating `P(f1, f2, f3 ... fn | c)` requires computing all possible combinations of features (if BOW uses sum pooling than even more!). We need another simplifying assumption called the **naive Bayes assumption** - the conditional independence between features given the same class. Hence, we can multiply probabilites as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "So how do we train the classifier? How does it learn what actually is *P(c)* and *P(f|c)*? Starting with the first probability, we can simply use frequencies and derive it from the probability definition: the probability of a class in the dataset is the number of documents of this class divided be the total number of all documents. \n",

    "Learning the probability of a features given a class *P(f<sub>i</sub>|c)* isn't more complicated. We assume a feature is just the existence of a word in the document’s bag of words (set of the vocabulary *V*), and so we’ll want *P(w|c)*, which we compute as **fraction of times the word w<sub>i</sub> appears among all words in all documents of topic c**.\n",
