    "The is a primary step in the process of text cleaning. If we scrap some text from HTML/XML sources, we’ll need to get rid of all the tags, HTML entities, punctuation, non-alphabets, and any other kind of characters that might not be a part of the language. The general methods of such cleaning involve **regular expressions**, which can be used to filter out most of the unwanted texts.\n",

    "However, sometimes, depending on the type of data, we want to retain certain types of punctuation. Consider for example human-generated tweets which you want to classify as very angry, angry, neutral, happy, and very happy. Simple sentiment analysis might find it hard to differentiate between a happy, and very happy sentiment because the only difference between a happy and a very happy tweet might be punctuation.\n",

    "Stopwords are the words that are used very frequently. Words like “of, are, the, it, is” are some examples of stopwords. In applications like document search engines and document classification, where keywords are more important than general terms, removing stopwords can be a good idea. However, if there’s some application about, for instance, songs lyrics search, or searching for specific quotes, stopwords can be important. \n",

One way is to count all the word occurrences, and providing a threshold value on the count, and getting rid of all the terms/words occurring more than the specified threshold value. The other way is to have a predetermined list of stopwords, which can be removed from the list of tokens/tokenized sentences. In the beginning, the second one may be better, as determining thresholds can be quite difficult.\n",

    "### 3.6 Lemmatising and Stemming\n",
    "Lemmatisation and stemming both refer to a process of reducing a word to its root. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas, a lemma is an actual word. It’s a handy tool if you want to avoid treating different forms of the same word as different words, e.g. *love, loved, loving*\n",

    "\n",
    "**Stemming:** considered, considering, consider → “consid”\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, there may be no significant difference between lemmatising and stemming when training classifiers. However, the best way to find out how they work and when to use which solution is to try them! NLTK comes with many different in-built lemmatisers and stemmers, so just plug and play.\n",

    "Although bag-of-words is simple, easy to implement and in some applications works quite well, it has some serious limitations. The first one is the one we have already discussed - the word order does not matter. If the purpose of the model is to classify texts based on some keywords then it may be not important what was the order of words. However, it's quite tricky - two single words may have very different meaning when they occur together. Let's take a closer look at this example:"
