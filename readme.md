# NLP Jupyter Notebooks repo

## About this series of notebooks
This mini-course has been prepared with the aim of showing rather a practical side of natural language processing (NLP) than detailed theoretical aspects. Although some fundamental theory is necessary, notebooks contain many fragments of code ready to be copied & pasted into your project. The course will give you a good foundation and prepare you to tackle more advanced topics.
