# NLP Jupyter Notebooks repo

## About this series of notebooks
This mini-course has been prepared with the aim of showing rather practical side of the NLP than detailed theoretical aspects.

The first 5 notebooks introduce important topics and their implementation using Python and some well-known modules. Notebook 6 presents how to solve a complete NLP classification problem using different techniques and visualizations.
